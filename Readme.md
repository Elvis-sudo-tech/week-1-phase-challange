# JavaScript Functions - Code Challenge

This project contains a collection of JavaScript functions that solve common problems, including a Student Grade Generator, Net Salary Calculator, and Speed Detector. The goal of the project is to demonstrate practical use of JavaScript functions and array manipulation, as well as handling user input and output.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following functions:
1. **Student Grade Generator** - Prompts the user for input, validates it, and maps it to the corresponding grade.
2. **Net Salary Calculator** - Calculates a user's net salary, accounting for tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
3. **Speed Detector** - Evaluates a driver's speed and calculates the demerit points or the need for a license suspension.

## Requirements

- **JavaScript**: The solution is written entirely in JavaScript.
- **Node.js**: This project uses Node.js to run the JavaScript code.
- **Input**: The functions are designed to accept user input either through the command line or predefined values.

## How to Run the Code
